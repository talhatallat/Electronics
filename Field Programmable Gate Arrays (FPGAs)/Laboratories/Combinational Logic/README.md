# Combinational Logic

## Laboratory Aim
The aim of this lab is to use the Vivado Design Environment to design simulate and synthesise a combinational logic. 

The purpose of this lab is to create VHDL behavioural design source code and simulate code for testing the design and test combination logic on Artix-7 development board and apply signals throw the switch to confirm that the design works according to the plan.
