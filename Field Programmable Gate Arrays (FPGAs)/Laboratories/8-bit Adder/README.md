# 8-bit Adder

## Laboratory Aim
The aim of this lab was to build a Cascaded 8 bit adder in Vivado. 

➢ Importing:

* VHDL behavioural design source code

* VHDL library source code 

* A VHDL simulation (Test bench) code to test the design

➢ Implement the design on the Artix-7 FPGA via the Basys3 development board

➢ Apply signals tot eh board switches to confirm that the design works as planned
