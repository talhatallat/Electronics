# Basys-3 Comparator

* In this laboratory, the Vivado Design Environment will be used to design, simulate and synthesise a digital comparator circuit
* Finally, the functionality of the finished design will be tested by implementing it and programming it onto the Artix-7 FPGA of the Digilent Basys3 board
* To complete this lab you will need the Report Template, headphones to listen to online videos and the Digilent Basys3 FPGA development board
